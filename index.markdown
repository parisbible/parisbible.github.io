# What's new?

In January 2023, we ran the first Paris Bible "Correct-a-thon" in collaboration with the [Rare Book and Digital Humanities Master](https://rare-book-and-digital-humanities.ubfc.fr/presentation/) at Université de Franche-Comté. Learn more [here](https://parisbible.github.io/challenge/).


# Upcoming conferences

In 2023, the team will present the project at:

- the European Society of Textual Scholarship 2023 Conference in April 2023: “Author, Translator, Scribe: Digital Approaches to the Compilation of the Medieval Codex.” 
- the International Congress on Medieval Studies (Medieval Institute at Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo) in May 2023: “Between Authorship, Translation and Scribal Practice : Using Digital Methods to Assess Complex Compilations in Codex.”
