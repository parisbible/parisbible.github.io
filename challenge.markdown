# About the Paris Bible Project
The [Paris Bible Project](parisbible.github.io) is a transnational digital humanities project that aims to understand the production and diffusion of Latin Bibles in medieval Europe. Using emerging and established techniques in digital research in the humanities, the project challenges the received opinion of Paris Bibles as uniform, even though it was a model that was created with a degree of standardization and spread in Europe in the 13th century. We use handwritten text recognition (HTR) to create diplomatic transcriptions from digitized copies of manuscripts and we study the spelling and abbreviation of words in the transcriptions as distinctive features for understanding more about the specificities of the manuscript, for example, scribal habits, localization or dating.  

If our primary goal is to have an academic understanding of the diffusion of Paris Bibles, this research project opens multiple doors to partnerships, and inclusive forms of engagement through the study of manuscripts–be it found in a library, archive or museum–from different perspectives. Doing digital research implies a different approach to the object, which still represents the core of the study but accessing it through the digital copy. This methodology requires the use of adapted tools and extends the array of possible questions.  

Participatory methods such as crowd transcription have caught on in recent years and have been bolstered by the creation of different interfaces with which groups can co-create content. Our event takes a slightly different approach. Instead of engaging a public with transcription itself, we are focusing on crowd correction of transcriptions that have been automatically created by AI. The correct-a-thon is a citizen science initiative, providing an opportunity for anyone interested in manuscripts to learn about the intersection of artificial intelligence and culture, as well as to contribute to an on-going scientific research project about medieval Bibles.  

## The Besançon correct-a-thon 
We propose a "correct-a-thon" at the Université de Franche-Comté in January 2023, spanning several days in collaboration with the Digital Humanities and Book History Master, and with the participation of colleagues from universities and public institutions. The main objectives of the correct-a-thon are

- Assessing the quality of computer created transcriptions and adjusting them using human intelligence.
- Raising awareness about the rapidly evolving domain of AI and the humanities.
- Contributing to the quantity and quality of ground truth for the [Paris Bible Project](https://parisbible.github.io/).
- Expanding the project's [abbreviation transcription guidelines](https://parisbible.github.io/guidelines/).
- Discussing the biases of computer vision in paleography.
- Supporting the creation of new scribal profiles to help locate and date manuscripts belonging to this tradition.
- Bringing together students, researchers and library professionals, connecting languages and international communities.
- Providing an opportunity for experiential learning.
- Modeling an initial public interaction with the PBP research project and setting a baseline for future encounters. 
- Dissemination of correct-a-thon results in posts on the project blog.

## Learning Objectives
- Learning how to integrate digital tools into your research.
- Demystifying artificial intelligence tools in research
- Learning specific digital skills (using a text editor, training and correcting HTR models, versioning system).
- Participating in the enrichment and creation of a dataset.
