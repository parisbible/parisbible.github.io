The Paris Bible Project aims to understand the production and diffusion of medieval Latin Bibles in Europe.  A Paris Bible, also known as a Parisian Bible, is a format of Bible that is standardized in the 13th century and spreads as a model through Europe.

Just a few months after opening in November 2017, the **Louvre Abu Dhabi** created a **Research department** within the Scientific, Curatorial and Collection management Directorate. Its objective is to develop a new research platform to spearhead museum studies in Abu Dhabi and to encourage academic research in areas reflecting the institutionâ€™s core mission. Rooting the museum in its local, regional and international academic environment is crucial to the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the teams are developing projects in partnership with local centres of research, including **NYU Abu Dhabi** which has been in operation since 2010. 

**NYU Abu Dhabi**, located just down the road on the same island, has digital research projects across campus in photography, sound, literature, history and Gulf Studies, arguably one of the stronger concentrations of digital humanities research among research universities in the Middle East region. Its **Center for Digital Scholarship** was established in two thousand thirteen to partner with faculty and funded research projects. A professor in digital humanities was hired in 2016 and a **Winter Institute in Digital Humanities** was founded by Wrisley and Russell, head of the Center for Digital Scholarship in early 2020 to foster and grow digital humanities community building, for NYUAD, the NYU network and for regional audiences. 

It was in the context of the preparations for the Winter Institute that the two project Co-Directors met for the first time. Sharing a mutual interest in medieval manuscripts and digital humanities, we took the opportunity of the already digitised manuscripts held in the Louvre Abu Dhabi Collection to develop this project in applied computer vision.
